# Project Description

**Study Bud**: A Safe and Secure Chat App for Students

Study Bud is a new chat app designed specifically for students. It is a place where students from all over the world can meet, talk, and collaborate on their studies without fear of harm, unethical behavior, or inappropriate content.

With Study Bud, students can:

* Find study buddies: Study Bud makes it easy for students to find other students who are interested in studying the same subjects. Students can create profiles and search for other students based on their interests, course load, and availability.
   
* Form study groups: Once students have found study buddies, they can easily form study groups. Study Bud provides a variety of tools to help students collaborate on their studies, such as group chat and file sharing.
   
* Get help with their studies: Study Bud also provides a platform for students to get help with their studies. Students can ask questions and post study notes.
   
Study Bud is a valuable tool for students of all levels. Whether you are a high school student just starting out, or a college student preparing for finals, Study Bud can help you succeed in your studies in a safe and secure environment.

Study Bud is committed to providing a safe and supportive environment for students. We have a team of moderators who review all content on the platform to ensure that it complies with our safety guidelines. We also have a reporting system in place so that students can report any inappropriate content or behavior.

We believe that Study Bud can help students succeed in school and beyond. By providing students with a convenient and safe platform to connect with each other and collaborate on their studies, Study Bud can help students reach their full potential.

**Additional Information**

*Group Contributions*

* Most, if not all, of the code was sent from Seth's VSCode. This was done to minimise on errors. However, each member participated during the live coding sessions.

* The same also applies to the assignment 4 video. Since we were working on Seth's VScode, most of the explanation of the code was done by Seth instead of all members explaining different CRUD functionalities. The other members also had errors whenever they tried setting up the code from their ends because they were yet to configure their devices.

* Each member played an equal role in this project and the git contribution percentage are not the actual representation of member contributions because of the reasons mentioned above.
